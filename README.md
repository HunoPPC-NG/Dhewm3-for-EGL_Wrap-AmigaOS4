# ABOUT

_dhewm 3_ is a _Doom 3_ GPL source port, know to work on at least Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD.

The goal of _dhewm 3_ is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable
platforms.

Bugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without
altering the original gameplay.

This project 

Dhewm3 for AmigaOS4 PowerPC with EGL_Wrap, Gl4es, Warp3D NOVA and Opengles2 library
- A-EON (NOVA and Opengles 2.0) http://www.a-eon.com/
- GL4es https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es
- EGL_Wrap library http://hunoppc.amiga-projects.net/

This distribution uses these functions of these 4 projects :

**The project is hosted at:** https://github.com/HunoPPC-NG/Dhewm3-for-EGL_Wrap-AmigaOS4

Dhewm3 for Update and support a standard code of engine  : https://github.com/dhewm

Gl4ES for Opengl renderer : https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es



# CHANGES

Compared to the original _DOOM 3_, the changes of _dhewm 3_ worth mentioning are:

- SDL for low level OS support, OpenGL and input handling
- OpenAL for audio output, all OS specific audio backends are gone
- OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)
- Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)



# GENERAL NOTES

## Game data and patching

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You must patch the game to the latest version (1.3.1). See the FAQ for details, including
how to get the game data from Steam on Linux or OSX.

Note that _Doom 3_ and _Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil_ are available from the Steam store at

http://store.steampowered.com/app/9050/

http://store.steampowered.com/app/9070/

You can also buy Steam keys at the Humble Store; currently this seems the only way to
buy a Doom3 Steam key in Germany (Note that Germans still can't buy the RoE Addon there):

Required libraries are not part of the tree. These are:

-AmigaOS4 4.1
- Warp3D NOVA from A-EON
- OpenglES2 from A-EON
- EGL_Wrap library from HunoPPC 
- zlib (static)
- libjpeg (static)
- libogg (static)
- libvorbis (static)
- libvorbisfile (may be part of libvorbis) (static)
- OpenAL (OpenAL Soft required, Creative's and Apple's versions are made of fail) (static)
- SDL v1.2 (static)

## Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows

The Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".

***Note*** that this **does *not* change the visual appereance** of the game.
The shadows look the same, they're just created in a slightly different way.
In theory there might be a small performance impact, but on hardware less than
ten years old it shouldn't make a difference.

## MayaImport

The code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee
you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.
